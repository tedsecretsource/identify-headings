A plugin that adds ID attributes to heading, paragraph, and list elements

# Identify Headings - Allow visitors to link to parts of your page by automatically adding IDs to important elements #

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABR-nzAYs9I

This small and unintrusive plugin adds ID attributes to all heading, paragraph, and list elements in a post or page. It does not modify existing IDs.

Adding IDs to these elements allows people to link to the heading, paragraph, or list element that they are interested in. This is especially important on sites that have lots of content on a page or post. Without this plugin, site visitors have to go to the page and then scroll down to try and find the item of interest.

This plugin does not modify the display of your content at all. It simply adds missing IDs and a class (in case you want to modify the display yourself). Also, this plugin does not modify your content in the database. It adds the IDs as part of the page display.

This plugin does not have any configuration screens. No configuration is required.

[See this page](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/supporting/faq) for an example of how this plugin could be enhanced (when you roll over a heading, a hash character appears to tell you you can link to it).

# Installation #
There are no special requirements to install this plugin. Just use the standard WordPress plugin installation routine.
